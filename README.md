## Description

I wanted to create a professional portfolio website using REACT that provides all my best projects and ways to contact me. Through this, I was able to learn how react works and improve my previous portfolio site with a better version! This also allowed me to see how much I have improved within these past 6 months learning.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

Install: `npm i` for node modules

## Usage

The website features a navigation bar positioned at the top for easy navigation. Upon entering the site, the about page is automatically displayed. Users can navigate to the project tab to explore my work and the contact tab to send me a quick message. In the footer, a short message is accompanied by links to my social media.
